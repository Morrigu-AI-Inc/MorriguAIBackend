This JSON schema defines the structure of the request body for creating a new workspace. Here's a breakdown of the schema:

- `name` (required string): The name of the workspace.
- `type` (required string): The type of the workspace, either "trial" or "paid".
- `billingInfo` (required object):
  - `creditCardToken` (required string): The token representing the credit card information for billing.
  - `billingContactEmail` (required string): The email address of the billing contact.

The schema enforces that the `name` and `type` properties are required, and the `billingInfo` object is required if the workspace type is "paid". Additionally, the `billingInfo` object must contain both `creditCardToken` and `billingContactEmail` properties.

Note that the schema does not allow any additional properties other than the ones defined.
