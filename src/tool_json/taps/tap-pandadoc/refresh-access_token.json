This JSON schema defines the request body for refreshing an access token in PandaDoc's OAuth 2.0 authentication flow. The key properties are:

- `grant_type` (required, string): Must be set to the value "refresh_token".
- `refresh_token` (required, string): The refresh token obtained from the initial token request.
- `client_id` (required, string): The client ID of your application registered with PandaDoc.
- `client_secret` (required, string): The client secret of your application.

All four properties are marked as required for a valid refresh token request.
