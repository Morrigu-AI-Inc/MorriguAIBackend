This JSON schema defines the structure of the URL path parameters required for the `DELETE /documents/{document_uuid}/recipients/{recipient_uuid}` endpoint. It has two required properties:

1. `document_uuid` (string): The unique identifier of the document from which the recipient should be removed.
2. `recipient_uuid` (string): The unique identifier of the recipient to be removed from the document.

Both of these properties are required for the request to be valid.
