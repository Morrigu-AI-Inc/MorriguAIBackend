This JSON schema defines the structure of the response when creating a linked object for a document using the PandaDoc API. The response is an object with the following properties:

1. `id` (string): The unique identifier of the newly created linked object.
2. `type` (string): The type of the linked object.
3. `attributes` (object): An object containing additional attributes of the linked object, which must include:
   - `name` (string, required): The name of the linked object.
   - `url` (string, required): The URL of the linked object.

Note that the `id`, `type`, and `attributes` properties are required in the response object.
