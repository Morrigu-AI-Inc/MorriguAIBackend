This JSON schema defines the structure of the response for listing documents. The main properties are:

- `count`: The total number of documents found.
- `next`: A URL for the next page of results (if any).
- `previous`: A URL for the previous page of results (if any).
- `results`: An array of document objects, each containing properties like `id`, `status`, `name`, `recipient_status`, and various date fields.

The `results` array contains objects with the following properties for each document:

- `id`: The unique identifier of the document.
- `status`: The current status of the document (e.g., "draft", "sent", "completed").
- `name`: The name of the document.
- `recipient_status`: The status of the recipient's interaction with the document (e.g., "awaiting", "viewed", "completed").
- `date_created`: The date and time when the document was created.
- `date_modified`: The date and time when the document was last modified.
- `date_status_changed`: The date and time when the status of the document was last changed.
