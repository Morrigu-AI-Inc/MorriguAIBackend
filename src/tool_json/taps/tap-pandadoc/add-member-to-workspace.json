This JSON schema describes the request body for adding a member to a workspace. The schema has one required property `member`, which is an object with the following properties:

1. `user_id` (required, string): The ID of the user being added to the workspace.
2. `role` (required, string): The role of the member in the workspace. It can be either `"workspace_admin"` or `"member"`.

Both `user_id` and `role` are required properties within the `member` object.
