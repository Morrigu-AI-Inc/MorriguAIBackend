  "description": "About REST API REST API is one of several web interfaces that you can use to access your Salesforce data without using the Salesforce user interface. With API access, you can perform operations and integrate Salesforce into your applications as you like. You can use REST API tools to create, manipulate, and search data in Salesforce by sending HTTP requests to endpoints in Salesforce. Depending on where you send requests, you access and operate on different pieces of information, called resources. Resources include records, query results, metadata, and more. REST API uses RESTful architecture to provide a straightforward and consistent interface. A primary benefit of REST API is that it doesn’t require much tooling to access your data. It’s simpler to use than SOAP API but still provides plenty of functionality. Although REST API is great for accessing and querying records, other Salesforce APIs, such as Bulk 2.0 API, Metadata API, and Connect REST API, offer additional functionality for specific tasks.",
